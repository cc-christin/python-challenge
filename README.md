# python-challenge
Complete the **two** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

### Before You Begin
* Create a new repository for this project called `python-challenge`.
* Inside your local git repository, create a directory for each Python Challenge. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **PyBank** and  **PyPoll**.
* Inside of each folder that you just created, add the following:

  * A new file called `main.py`. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
  * A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
  * An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

* Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

### Completed PyBank 
* Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company.
* [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv), dataset was given.
* The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* Final script generates text file:financial_analysis.txt and prints the following:

### Completed PyPoll 
* Help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
* [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv), dataset was given.
* The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.
* Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  *
* Final script generates text file:election_results.txt and prints the following:
